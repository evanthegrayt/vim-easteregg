# vim-easteregg
A colorful, dark-themed colorscheme for `vim`, inspired by
[Jellybeans.vim](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim/blob/master/colors/jellybeans.vim)

## About
A few years ago, I started using the `Jellybeans` colorscheme, but I've modified
it quite a bit over the years. This is the end result of my changes.

When I have more time, I'm probably going to fork the newest version of
`Jellybeans` and add my colors, as they handle italics and Graphical `vim`
settings better.

## Examples
[bash](resource/bash.jpg)

[ruby](resource/ruby.jpg)

[vim script](resource/vimscript.jpg)

## Configuration
This theme looks best with italics, but this is not enabled by default. To
enable italics, add this line to your `vimrc`, before setting the colorscheme:

```vim
let g:easteregg_use_italics = 1
colorscheme easteregg
```
